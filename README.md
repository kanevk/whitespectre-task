A task for Whitespectre


## Description
A group event will be created by an user. The group event should run for a whole number of days e.g.. 30 or 60.
There should be attributes to set and update the start, end and duration of the event and calculate the
missing value if 2 are given. The event also has a name, description (which supports formatting) and location.
The event should be draft or published. To publish all of the fields are required, it can be saved with only a
subset of fields before itâ€™s published. When the event is deleted/remove it should be kept in the database and marked as such.

Write an AR model, spec and migration for a GroupEvent that would meet the needs of the description above.
Then write the api controller and spec to support JSON request/responses to manage these GroupEvents.
For the purposes of this exercise, ignore auth.


Please provide your solution as a rails app called exercise_YYMMDD_yourname, sent as a zip file.

## Assumptions

 - group event has:
   - user_id
   - name
   - description
   - description_type
   - location
   - start
   - end
   - duration
   - status
 - For group event for any given 2 from the fields (start, end, and duration) we need to calculate the third field
 - The API have to support the following:
   - creating an event(assuming it will be always draft)
   - fetching singe event
   - event update(cannot change publish status)
   - pubishing an event + validations
   - delete event

 - The API has the following endpoints:
    - [X] GET /users/:user_id/group_events
    - [X] POST /users/:user_id/group_events
    - [x] GET /users/:user_id/group_events/:id
    - [X] PUT/PATCH /users/:user_id/group_events/:id
    - [x] DELETE /users/:user_id/group_events/:id
    - [x] POST /users/:user_id/group_events/:id/publish
    - [x] DELETE /users/:user_id/group_events/:id/publish

## Design decisions

 - The project using pattern matching because it's elegant and this is a demo project. I wouldn't use it for production platform, yet.
 - As a simpler approach I'm do not use serializer objects, but the AR models instead. For a bigger app I'd choose serializers.

## Setup

1. Install use a proper Ruby version 2.7.1.
```bash
  cd path-to-project
```

```bash
  rbenv install
```

*NOTE: If you don't use `rbenv` you've to install explicitly version 2.7.1*

2. Install dependecies

```
bundle
```


3. Create/migrate DB

```bash
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

4. Run tests

```bash
bundle exec rspec -fd
```
